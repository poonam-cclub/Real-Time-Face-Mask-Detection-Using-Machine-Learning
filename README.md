Real Time Face Mask Detection Using Machine Learning
-**Step-1:** Collect face data with and without mask
we have a library known as OpenCV which will help us to read the image and return array of color pixels. Command:-  
 ```bash
!pip install opencv-python        
import cv2
```
-**Step-2:** Train Data Using Machine Learning
-**Step-3:** Do Prediction On Live Data Using Machine Learning

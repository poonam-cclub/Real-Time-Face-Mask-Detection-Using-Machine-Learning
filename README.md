Real Time Face Mask Detection Using Machine Learning
step 1:Collect face data with and without mask
we have a library known as OpenCV which will help us to read the image and return array of color pixels. Command:-  
1- !pip install opencv-python        
2- import cv2  
step 2:Train Data Using Machine Learning
step 3:Do Prediction On Live Data Using Machine Learning
